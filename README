NAME
    Object::SpaceBackStr - Object which stringifies to space+backspace ("
    \b")

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Object::SpaceBackStr;

     die Object::SpaceBackStr->new; # dies without seemingly printing anything

DESCRIPTION
    Object::SpaceBackStr objects are like Object::BlankStr and
    Object::NulStr objects, but stringify to space+backspace (" \b") so when
    printed they don't seem to output anything.

    Choosing between the three: Object::BlankStr truly doesn't print
    anything as it stringifies to an empty string, but since empty strings
    are false in Perl it has some gotchas (see Object::BlankStr
    documentation for more details). Object::NulStr stringifies to "\0"
    which are also invisible in most terminals when printed, but when it
    doesn't work, you can try if Object::SpaceBackStr does.

    So far the only case I've found this to be useful is for die()-ing
    without seemingly printing anything. If you just use 'die;' or 'die "";'
    Perl will print the default "Died at ..." message. But if you say 'die
    Object::SpaceBackStr->new;' Perl will die without seemingly printing
    anything.
